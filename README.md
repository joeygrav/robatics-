i think light bot is the easiest way to learn robot programming even though it's not easy but easier than the actual programming.. and i recommend people to try it out because it's useful for the beginers and i did my reasearch and it looks like to define a robot it looks like Not all functions are declared void Sometimes you may wish to capture a mathematical computation in a function for instance or perform some other task that requires you to get information back out of the function at the end The function will return a value causing it to behave as if the function call itself were a value in the line that called it.
